          <a href = "https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/guides/observations/how-we-measure-wind">Wind speed</a> is normally measured by a cup anemometer consisting of three or four cups, 
          conical or hemispherical in shape, mounted symmetrically about a vertical spindle. 
          The wind blowing into the cups causes the spindle to rotate.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Wind speed near the ground is much affected by 
          such factors as the roughness of the ground and the presence of buildings, trees and other 
          obstacles in the vicinity. This is why the standard height for surface wind observations is 10m. 
          Wind speed increases with higher elevations above the surface because the pressure gradients tend to be greater, the 
          density of the air is less, and the drag due to friction is much less. 
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Wind speed varies considerably, even using observations at a rate of 1 per second, and can 
          vary by 10% per minute in "steady" wind. The fluctuations in wind speed have been researched carefully 
          because of their impact on designs of things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XggxeuFDaDU">bridges</a>, buildings and wind turbines.
