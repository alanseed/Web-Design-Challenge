# Web-Design-Challenge

## Introduction
Latitude is a web page that uses the observations from a large number of weather stations to explore the relationship between weather and latitude.  

The design of the site is intensionally minimalist, which follows my general approach to code and design. Keeping a space simple and uncluttered, using colour for very specific purposes, in this case the "home" button on each page to make it stand out.  

The design is based on the Bootstrap 5 library. Cards are used on all but the Data page to give a consistent look and feel to the site.  

Each page has a link to an external web site usually a site that carries further information on the weather element and how is it measured.
